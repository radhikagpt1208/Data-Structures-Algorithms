21. Shortest path in UNDIRECTED UNWEIGHTED Graph - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/shortest-path-in-undirected-graph-having-unit-distance/1
    (this can be done using simple bfs since the graph is unweighted. topo aproach will not be used since there might be a cycle)

Note: Use dijkstras algo only when there might be a cycle because above approach won't work (topological sort is only for acyclic graphs). Above approach has a better complexity than dijkstras. 

22. Shortest path in UNDIRECTED WEIGHTED GRAPH using DIJKSTRA - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/implementing-dijkstra-set-1-adjacency-matrix/1

Note: Dijkstras is not applicable to graphs with negative weight cycles. Time complexity of Dijkstra - O(ElogV)
